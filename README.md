# FileOrganizer

## Description

Have you ever felt like your room is more organized than your Downloads folder? This Python program solves that issue!

Credit to GeeksForGeeks for guiding me: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/automatically-organize-downloads-folder-in-python/

Beyond the base line, I've also made it to where the program doesn't get tripped up by periods in file names and have made it so the user can input any folder they'd like to organize, not just the hard-coded downloads folder.

## How to run
**THIS PROCESS IS NOT REVERSABLE!**

1. Open a terminal window
2. cd into the directory where you've saved the .py file using the terminal
3. Type python .\FileOrganizer.py in the terminal
4. Input the address of the directory you'd like to organize. 

This will take every file in the directory and create a new folder in the inputted directory based on their file types. It will then put each file of a respective type into its respective folder.
